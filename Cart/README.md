This is the Cart Project for MIT xPRO

Import new photos from picsum  (Links to an external site.)

List the price and stock of each item

Add the price at Checkout

Build the delete functionality: deleting an item from the cart should cause checkout to restock the item

Make use of the ‚ÄúdoFetch‚Äù function to make a call to the API

Make use of ‚ÄúsetItems‚Äù to update the existing items

As you work on this, consider the user interface. Are there adaptations you could make to the delete functionality to make it more intuitive to the user? How can you prevent users from accidentally deleting items from their cart?
